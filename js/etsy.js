This piece has hand-stamped lettering which have been filled with a metal paint and then layered  and distressed to look vintage. There is a filigree flower riveted on one side. A cluster of handmade wire-wrapped rust colored glass flowers hangs over the pendant to keep the lettering subtle. Matching glass flowers have been strung on the chain up the left side, some with tiny rhinestone accents in them. The chain and all of the hardware has an aged vintage brass finish. This necklace measures 30&quot; long and has a lobster clasp with one last flower hanging on the back end of the chain. The clasp easily hooks into any link to wear this shorter if you like. The pendant measures approximately 1.5&quot; not including the ring, and each glass flower measures about 1\/2&quot; long. \n\nAll of my jewelry is one of a kind...I will repeat certain styles and colors, however I will not make exact copies of any piece. \n\nI use only quality materials, and I love getting my hands on some difficult to find beads and findings. The majority of my components are not available in local stores, so you can be assured you have a unique piece of artisan jewelry!\n\nI take great pride in all of my jewelry pieces, and should anything break or even if you accidentally damage it, please contact me to do the repairs. \n\nThis set will be packaged in a brown paper gift box tied with ribbon and shipped in a bubble mailer. \n\nNOTE: My mannequin is a mini...please check actual measurements as a necklace may appear to be longer than it actually is. I use a macro lens for the fine detail photos, this can also distort the perception of actual size. I make every attempt to get the colors to show true to life, but occasionally they can be slightly off. Please contact me before purchasing if you need more verification of exact color. \n\nThank you so much for your interest in my shop!","creation_tsz":1444242355,"ending_tsz":1454873155,"original_creation_tsz":1444242355,"last_modified_tsz":1444242838,"price":"68.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["vintage","rustic","dog tag","flowers","glass beads","boho","eclectic","country girl","gypsy","bohemian","distressed","whiskey girl"],"category_path":["Jewelry","Necklace"],"category_path_ids":[68887482,69151567],"materials":["charm","metal","rhinestone","glass"],"shop_section_id":null,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1444242355,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/251073110\/whiskey-girl-handstamped-rustic-vintage?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":0,"num_favorers":0,"shipping_template_id":10262723584,"processing_min":null,"processing_max":null,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2015","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":null,"is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":1218,"taxonomy_path":["Jewelry","Necklaces","Beaded Necklaces"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":846497282,"hex_code":"9A938C","red":154,"green":147,"blue":140,"hue":30,"saturation":9,"brightness":60,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1444242356,"listing_id":251073110,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8520648\/il_75x75.846497282_50bg.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8520648\/il_170x135.846497282_50bg.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8520648\/il_570xN.846497282_50bg.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8520648\/il_fullxfull.846497282_50bg.jpg","full_height":1148,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":846497386,"hex_code":"B4B1AF","red":180,"green":177,"blue":175,"hue":24,"saturation":2,"brightness":70,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1444242356,"listing_id":251073110,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8520648\/il_75x75.846497386_slya.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8520648\/il_170x135.846497386_slya.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8520648\/il_570xN.846497386_slya.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8520648\/il_fullxfull.846497386_slya.jpg","full_height":1068,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":846497404,"hex_code":"97908A","red":151,"green":144,"blue":138,"hue":28,"saturation":8,"brightness":59,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1444242357,"listing_id":251073110,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8520648\/il_75x75.846497404_4anz.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8520648\/il_170x135.846497404_4anz.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8520648\/il_570xN.846497404_4anz.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8520648\/il_fullxfull.846497404_4anz.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":955},{"listing_image_id":846270885,"hex_code":"B8B5B3","red":184,"green":181,"blue":179,"hue":24,"saturation":2,"brightness":72,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1444242357,"listing_id":251073110,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8520648\/il_75x75.846270885_q18x.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8520648\/il_170x135.846270885_q18x.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8520648\/il_570xN.846270885_q18x.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8520648\/il_fullxfull.846270885_q18x.jpg","full_height":1093,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":846270841,"hex_code":"8F847D","red":143,"green":132,"blue":125,"hue":23,"saturation":12,"brightness":56,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1444242357,"listing_id":251073110,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/8520648\/il_75x75.846270841_1y4f.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/8520648\/il_170x135.846270841_1y4f.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/8520648\/il_570xN.846270841_1y4f.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/8520648\/il_fullxfull.846270841_1y4f.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":8520648,"shop_name":"TurquoiseAndTrailers","user_id":7988324,"creation_tsz":1401817075,"title":"Creating a few of my favorite things...","announcement":"I am currently adding a number of my beautiful distressed picture frames!

If you absolutely require a tracking number from the US Mail, please let us know in a convo prior to placing your order, and we will let you know if an extra fee applies.  \r\n\r\nWhen delivering to residences, it is UPS and the US Mail&#39;s policy to not require a signature.  Should you require someone to sign for the package(s) please let us know and we can let you know what the additional cost would be.\r\n\r\nThe addressee MUST BE KNOWN by the Post Office, UPS, FED-EX or other delivery service to reside at the address you are shipping to.  If the addressee is not known to reside there, you MUST address the label with a C\/O (care of) someone that is known to reside there.\r\n\r\nIf you have us ship to an address, and the Post Office deems it to be UNDERLIVERABLE or UNDELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED or some similar terminology, and we have addressed the package as you have instructed, our obligation has been completed at that point.  Should the package be returned to us, we will contact you with a new shipping price to re-mail it to you.  Should the package not be returned to us, or returned damage, we will not be responsible for any refund or replacement of any amount.\r\n\r\nLOST PACKAGES SHIPPED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES:\r\nIf your package does not arrive by the estimated date provided by the post office, UPS or other delivery service, we will decide to either replace or refund your purchase 14 business days, excluding holidays, after the delivery service&#39;s estimated delivery date.  The only exception would be FIRST CLASS MAIL, which would be 21 business days, excluding holidays.  This will be an allowable timeframe for misrouted packages to arrive to you.\r\n\r\nWe have had instances where packages delivered to apartment buildings were delayed as the mailman decided not to leave the package in the hallway unattended.\r\n\r\nWhen we send you the shipping convo, it would be a good idea to arrange to have the package delivered to a neighbor (leave a note for the mailman) or ask the post office to hold any packages at the post office for you to pickup.\r\n\r\nUPS WILL LEAVE packages unattended, so you should definately arrange to be home or leave a note for the UPS driver to deliver to a neighbor.  The neighbor would need to be a next door apt as UPS will not deliver to another building free of charge.\r\n\r\nCANADIAN and INTERNATIONAL shipments: If you require a tracking number, UPS is the only option. Please contact us to see if the shipping charges shown in the listing is for UPS or Mail. Any duties and taxes will be the responsibility of the customer.  Shipments made to Canada or Internationally by a service other than UPS (ie: Postal Service) are not guarranteed as the tracking numbers are only good until the package reaches the US border, then the receiving country takes control.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSURANCE:  \r\nAll shipments ARE NOT insured.  Should you require insurance for lost packages, damage, etc, let us know prior to placing your order so we may give you a price.  Any packages delivered to you in a damaged condition MUST be reported to the delivery person BEFORE YOU SIGN for the package.  Any damaged packages that have not been reported to the delivery person before you sign, will not be refunded or exchanged by us.","policy_refunds":"Our items are all made to order, so once an order has been entered and work begun there is no way of refunding your purchase should you decide to cancel.

Do not use Windex or similar products because it will leave a residue behind that will prevent the sticker from adhering well.\r\n\r\nStep 2\r\nPrepare the sticker for application by firmly rubbing a squeegee or credit card across the \u201ctop\u201d transfer tape. This removes any air bubbles that may have formed and makes the sticker cling to the transfer tape.\r\n\r\nStep 3\r\nPeel the white paper \u201cback\u201d backing off the sticker. If the sticker clings to the backing, slowly replace the paper backing and repeat Step 2.\r\n\r\nStep 4\r\nSlowly lower the sticker onto the surface and rub it in place firmly with a squeegee or credit card. \r\n\r\nStep 5\r\nSlowly peel the \u201ctop\u201d clear transfer tape off at an angle.

This is done on the eve of your wedding day. Each letter then gets sealed in its own envelope. \n\nDuring the ceremony the Bride and Groom put their letters in the box with the wine and lock it. \n\nYou set an anniversary to open it. Maybe even engrave the date to be opened on the box.

Please become familiar with them before purchase.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns please feel free to contact us at any time.","policy_payment":"Payment\r\n\r\nWe accept Credit Cards, Etsy Gift Cards, Paypal, Money Orders, Checks, E-Checks, and cash. If you are ordering from anywhere other then the US you must send us payment in USD currency.\r\n\r\nWe will begin processing your order as soon as we receive payment. This means if you are mailing payment, or use an e-check the payment has to not only arrive to us, but also clear before we will begin going into production on your order. We ask if you are mailing payment to let us know when you have mailed it so we can keep an eye out for it. We will let you know when it arrives, and if it needs to clear when it has cleared.\r\n\r\nWe are also not responsible for any lost payments in the mail, so send it safely!\r\n\r\nYou have 14 days to pay for an item before it will be re-listed and the transaction cancelled. If any problems arise let us know and we will see if there is anything we can workout.\r\n","policy_shipping":"Increase in shipping rates! The USPS has increased it&#39;s rates this year, domestic parcels aren&#39;t much higher, but International rates have gone up by at least 60%. We do our best to keep our rates as low as possible, but there isn&#39;t much more we can do.\r\n\r\nOur Rates:\r\nWe ship glass, and other heavy sometimes fragile items. This means it can get quite expensive. We pack everything as best as we can but that means more weight and sometimes heavier boxes. If we find a cheaper way to ship we will lower our rates, but until they they have to stay where they are, and I promise you most times we eat 30% of the costs.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUSA\/Domestic:\r\nWe ship USPS First Class, which can be up to 5-7 business days. You have the option to upgrade to either priority (2-3 day) or Express shipping (next day). These all have an upgrade cost so please message me ahead of time so I can quote you the rates.\r\nWe also DO NOT OFFER TRACKING unless asked before the item has been marked shipped. If you need a tracking number please let us know when you make your purchase.\r\n\r\nWe can&#39;t give any &quot;guarantee delivery date&quot; because a lot of things can effect shipping times. Weather, holidays, ext. We however will do our best to get your package to you as soon as possible.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nInternational Orders:\r\nWe ship USPS airmail This is USUALLY 10-14 business days with no tracking. HOWEVER depending on your countries customs regulations they can take up to 3 MONTHS. We are in no way liable for items that are held up in customs, I&#39;m sorry it is a risk we all take when we order overseas. We can upgrade your shipping to Priority (6-10day with tracking) but once again These times can&#39;t be guaranteed with orders being held up in customs.\r\nIf you would like to upgrade your parcel to Priority you must let us know before the item has been marked shipped, and the parcel won&#39;t be shipped out until the shipping upgrade has been purchased.\r\n\r\n\r\nCustoms Fee and Charges:\r\nFor international orders, the shipping charges ONLY cover the cost of postage and not any customs fees, charges, or duties that may need to be paid. Please be aware of the customs regulations for your country prior to purchase, and contact the shops prior to purchase to ensure a smooth shipping experience.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLOST\/DELAYED PACKAGES:\r\nWe are not responsible for delayed\/lost packages, purely because the cause of the delay is completely out of our control. We will work with you the best that we can to figure out a solution for the problem, but we won&#39;t refund item\/shipping for delayed packages. A way around this is tracking, it lets both of us see where the packages have been and get them to you faster if there is an issue. We don&#39;t automatically offer tracking but if it is shipped within the USA we can add it on for free, just let us know before the item is marked shipped. For tracking on International orders you must upgrade to Priority shipping.\r\n\r\nIf you think your package is lost please contact us, this is an incredibly rare occurance, but we will work with you the best way we can to figure out a solution.\r\n\r\n*********Once again International buyers please keep in mind our packages usually get to you in 14 business days but they can be delayed by as much as 3 months depending on if they are held up in customs!***********************\r\n\r\nAgain if you have any questions or concerns contact us!","policy_refunds":"Return Policies are as follows:\r\n\r\n-No returns on any stickers, Vinyl Decals, or bumper stickers\r\n-Returns are accepted on glassware (excluding custom items, limited edition sets,clearance and upcycled products) 5 business days after item was received (or 7 days after item was purchased, whichever is longer). items MUST be in original condition to receive money back. Buyer pays return shipping. Once item has been received a refund will be authorized.\r\n-Clearance and upcycled products, and Limited edition sets are all final sale.\r\n-All custom orders, orders with added messages, names are all final sale\r\n\r\nIf you receive a damaged item all we require is a picture of the damaged glass. This must be provided no longer then 24 hours after the order has been received. Pictures of the packaging may also be required. We won&#39;t ask you to waste your time shipping it back to us, a picture works great and we will get you a replacement glass shipped out within 3 business days.\r\n","policy_additional":"Absolutely every glass we make to order. this takes at least 3-5 days for us to cut our stencils, affix them, sandblast, clean polish and pack. We do all of this Mondays-Saturdays (we take Sunday&#39;s off) so it usually takes a week until we ship out your glass. If you need the glass sooner, the best way is to contact us before you place your order, and we will make sure to do is ASAP.However if you place your order, and don&#39;t notify that you might need it by a certain timeframe it can take up to a week to ship.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe tend to recycle boxes we feel would be suitable\/strong enough to ship to you. So sometimes you might get a straight cardboard box,or maybe something else a little more primitive. If you would prefer a standard cardboard box please feel free to ask and we will be happy to oblige.\r\n","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1424125853,"vacation_autoreply":"We are taking a much needed vacation!\r\nBe back soon!","url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/FanArtGlassware?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":null,"num_favorers":896,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/071\/0\/8083699\/isla_fullxfull.16077764_jvtm42w7.jpg"}}],"params":{"limit":25,"offset":0,"page":null,"keywords":"whiskey","sort_on":"created","sort_order":"down","min_price":null,"max_price":null,"color":null,"color_accuracy":0,"tags":null,"category":null,"location":null,"lat":null,"lon":null,"region":null,"geo_level":"city","accepts_gift_cards":"false","translate_keywords":"false"},"type":"Listing","pagination":{"effective_limit":25,"effective_offset":0,"next_offset":25,"effective_page":1,"next_page":2}};
