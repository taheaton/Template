We try to source as many interesting, diverse and collectable items from English Inns and pubs as we can, frequenting Auctions is our hobby!  We also have bits from Europe and the USA in our collection.\r\n\r\n  We have our own home bar, we choose our bar for parties, get-togethers and family occasions.  Don&#39;t get us wrong, we still frequent our local pub, its a vital part of the community, but we now have an additional local, right next door, and its cheaper on taxi       fares.  \r\n\r\nOur bar has a 70&#39;s theme, so what began as sourcing unusual vintage items, became a complete passion, which we wanted to share, so CoopsRetroBar was born.  From Auctions, salerooms, Antique Shops and garage and boot sales, we have gathered together all the items you need to stock your own home bar, or to add to your Breweriana collection.\r\n\r\nVintage items can have alternative uses, an ashtray can be used for somewhere to keep your earrings, or as a soap dish. A whisky water jug makes a great milk cream or gravy jug.   Our own gravy boat here at home is a Jamesons water jug, a great table addition. Its fun and quirky to have these items around the house. \r\n\r\nA comprehensive catalogue of goodies, our shop is filled with iconic names from the alcohol and tobacco industries, some, sadly no longer with us. All our items have had a previous life, most of them have lived in pubs, bars and clubs.  Their condition will reflect use, but we will always point out faults and defects using photos and descriptions.  That said, the quality of our stock is first rate, with only a handful having any real problems and we offer those only because they are iconic and true retro items, the cost will be reduced acordingly.   Please be assured of our aim to provide high quality items to you at all times. \r\n\r\nIf your vintage item is a gift for someone else, and you would like it gift wrapped, please get in touch using the conversation option on the shop, we will provide (free of charge) personally stamped tissue paper wrapping.  We always include a Thank You card in our orders, but if the delivery address includes a gift and is different to your own, let us know and we will add a personalised  card from you instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave lots of fun incorporating these great vintage items into your bar and home, and enjoy wallowing in your mis-spent youth as much as we do.

Any orders received at weekends will be dispatched first thing on Monday morning.\r\n\r\nWE HAVE CHANGED OUR SHIPPING PRICES!\r\n\r\nHere at CoopsRetroBar we want to give our customers the best value we possibly can.  We have been trading here on Etsy now for 8 months and we are learning all the time, we are building a lovely customer base, and we like to keep up with what customers want, and indeed need.  The price of postage here in the UK varies so much, and some of the shipping prices we have been using seemed to us to be too expensive, so we are trying Standard shipping costs rather than our usual Tracked and Signed option.\r\n\r\nParcels for delivery here in the UK will now be sent Standard 2nd Class, and for overseas packages, we will be using International Standard - both using the tried and tested Royal Mail, via our excellent local Post Office. \r\n\r\nIn our experience of talking to friends and other Etsy sellers, it appears that there is no difference in the time it takes to receive packages whether they are Tracked and Signed or Standard delivery, in fact, sometimes signing for your parcel can be a nuisance as you have to be there when it is delivered, and if you are not, it is that dreaded trek to the postal facility to collect your item, and you may  have local agreements with your postal provider about places to leave parcels etc which should make it easier for you   We have every confidence that our service will still be quick, efficient and most of all, cheaper for our customers, which is why we have changed over. \r\n\r\nINSURANCE \r\n\r\nIf your item is valued up to \u00a320 GBP, the Royal Mail will Insure the item.  If however your purchase is valued over \u00a320 GBP, it is a good idea to use Tracked and Signed as an option, because Royal Mail will only cover more expensive items using that shipping method.  If the item is more than \u00a350 GBP and up to \u00a3250 (very unlikely on our shop), by paying an extra \u00a32.50 GBP, it will be covered, again using Royal Mail. Please convo us if you need any help deciding what to do. We are very approachable here at the Retro Bar and have helped many customers along the way with whatever we can to assist their needs. \r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL CUSTOMS\r\n\r\nWhen we send parcels overseas, they always have a Customs sticker listing the contents of the package and the value signed by us and dated.  We have had no problems from Customs in any country so far.\r\n\r\nDEADLINES\r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to contact us either using &#39;note from buyer&#39; link on the checkout, or convo section, if you need your item quickly, we can find the fastest way to get it to you, although we usually post our packages as soon as the order comes in anyway, sometimes within the hour.\r\n\r\nCONFIRMATION OF DISPATCH\r\n\r\nWe will send you a message as soon as your order has been dispatched, so you know it is on its way to you. \r\n\r\nAs we no longer use a Tracked and Signed option, we have no real way of knowing when you receive your package.  If you have time, and are happy to do so, please could you drop us a quick convo to let us know you are in receipt of your order.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","policy_refunds":"We hope you are happy with your items from CoopsRetroBar.
